QUESTION OF THE DAY:
Write a Java program to find the Sum and Average of Array Elements.
DESCRIPTION:
In the above example, we have created an array of named numbers. We have used the for...each loop to access each element of the array.
Inside the loop, we are calculating the sum of each element. Notice the line,
int arrayLength = number.length;
Here, we are using the length attribute of the array to calculate the size of the array. We then calculate the average using:
average = ((double)sum / (double)arrayLength);
As you can see, we are converting the int value into double. This is called type casting in Java.
CODE SOLUTION:
 public class Arrayavg {
 public static void main(String[] args) {

   int[] numbers = {2, -9, 0, 5, 12, -25, 22, 9, 8, 12};
   int sum = 0;
   Double average;
   for (int number: numbers) {
     sum += number;
   }
  
   int arrayLength = numbers.length;
   average =  ((double)sum / (double)arrayLength);

   System.out.println("Sum = " + sum);
   System.out.println("Average = " + average);
 }
}
CODE OUTPUT:
Sum = 36
Average = 3.6
