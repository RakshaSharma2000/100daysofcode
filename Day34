QUESTION OF THE DAY:
Use  of throws  keyword in exception handling.
DESCRIPTION:
When we run this program, if the file test.txt does not exist,
FileInputStream throws a FileNotFoundException which extends the IOException class.

If a method does not handle exceptions, the type of exceptions that may occur within it must be specified in the throws clause
so that methods further up in the call stack can handle them or specify them using throws keyword themselves.

The findFile() method specifies that an IOException can be thrown.
The main() method calls this method and handles the exception if it is thrown.
CODE SOLUTION:
import java.io.*;
public class Main {
  public static void findFile() throws IOException {
    File newFile=new File("test.txt");
    FileInputStream stream=new FileInputStream(newFile);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try{
      findFile();
    } catch(IOException e){
      System.out.println(e);
    }
  }
}
CODE OUTPUT:
java.io.FileNotFoundException: test.txt (No such file or directory)
