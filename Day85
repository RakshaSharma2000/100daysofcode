QUESTION OF THE DAY:
Java Comparator
DESCRIPTION:
Comparators are used to compare two objects. In this challenge, we create a comparator and use it to sort an array.
The Player class is provided in  editor. It has 2 fields: a name String and a score integer.
Given an array of n Player objects, write a comparator that sorts them in order of decreasing score; if 2
or more players have the same score, sort those players alphabetically by name. To do this, we must create a Checker class that implements the Comparator interface,
then write an int compare(Player a, Player b) method implementing the Comparator.compare(T o1, T o2) method.
CODE SOLUTION:
import java.util.*;
class Checker implements Comparator<Player>{
    @Override
    public int compare(Player a, Player b){
        if (a.score == b.score){
            return a.name.compareTo(b.name);//alphabetically
        } else {
            return b.score - a.score;//decreasing 
        }
    }
}

// Write your Checker class here

class Player{
    String name;
    int score;
    
    Player(String name, int score){
        this.name = name;
        this.score = score;
    }
}

class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scan.nextInt();

        Player[] player = new Player[n];
        Checker checker = new Checker();
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            player[i] = new Player(scan.next(), scan.nextInt());
        }
        scan.close();
     
        Arrays.sort(player, checker);
        for(int i = 0; i < player.length; i++){
            System.out.printf("%s %s\n", player[i].name, player[i].score);
        }
    }
}
