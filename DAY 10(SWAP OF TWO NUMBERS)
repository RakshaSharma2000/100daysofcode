QUESTION : SWAPPING OF TWO NUMBERS WITHOUT USING THIRD VARIABLES

CODE SOLUTION :
import java.util.*;
 class Swap{
    static void swapValuesWithoutUsingThirdVariable(int m,
                                                    int n)
    {
        m = m - n;
        n = m + n;
        m = n - m;
 System.out.println("Value of m is " + m
                           + " and Value of n is " + n);
    }
    public static void main(String[]Value of m is 5 and Value of n is 9
 args)
    {
        int m = 9, n = 5;
        swapValuesWithoutUsingThirdVariable(m, n);
    }
}
output:
Value of m is 5 and Value of n is 9

DESCRIPTION:
We can swap two numbers without using third variable. There are two common ways to swap two numbers without using third variable:

By + and -
By * and /
