QUESTION OF THE DAY:
Java 1D array
An array is a simple data structure used to store a collection of data in a contiguous block of memory. 
Each element in the collection is accessed using an index, and the elements are easy to find because they're stored sequentially in memory.
Because the collection of elements in an array is stored as a big block of data, we typically use arrays when we know exactly how many pieces of data we're going to have.
CODE SOLUTION:
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
	   
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scan.nextInt();
        int[] a = new int[n];
        for(int i = 0;i<n;i++)
        {
            a[i] = scan.nextInt();
        }
        scan.close();

        // Prints each sequential element in array a
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(a[i]);
        }
    }
}
