QUESTION OF THE DAY:
Java Method Overriding 2(Super Key)
DESCRIPTION:
When a method in a subclass overrides a method in superclass, it is still possible to call the overridden method using super keyword.
CODE SOLUTION:
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

class BiCycle{
	String define_me(){
		return "a vehicle with pedals.";
	}
}

class MotorCycle extends BiCycle{
	String define_me(){
		return "a cycle with an engine.";
	}
	
	MotorCycle(){
		System.out.println("Hello I am a motorcycle, I am "+ define_me());

		String temp=super.define_me(); //Fix this line

		System.out.println("My ancestor is a cycle who is "+ temp );
	}
	
}
class Solution{
	public static void main(String []args){
		MotorCycle M=new MotorCycle();
	}
}
OUTPUT:
Hello I am a motorcycle, I am a cycle with an engine.
My ancestor is a cycle who is a vehicle with pedals.
