QUESTION OF THE DAY:
Java program to illustrate creating an array of objects
DESCRIPTION:
An array of objects is created like an array of primitive-type data items in the following way. 

Student[] arr = new Student[5]; 
Here student is a user defined class.
The studentArray contains five memory spaces each of the size of student class in which the address of five Student objects can be stored. The Student
objects have to be instantiated using the constructor of the Student class, and their references should be assigned to the array elements.
CODE SOLUTION:
class Student {
    public int roll_no;
    public String name;
    Student(int roll_no, String name)
    {
        this.roll_no = roll_no;
        this.name = name;
    }
}
 public class Array{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Student[] arr;
        arr = new Student[5];
        arr[0] = new Student(1, "a");
        arr[1] = new Student(2, "b");
        arr[2] = new Student(3, "c");
        arr[3] = new Student(4, "d");
        arr[4] = new Student(5, "e");
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
            System.out.println("Element at " + i + " : "
                               + arr[i].roll_no + " "
                               + arr[i].name);
    }
}
OUTPUT:
Element at 0 : 1 a
Element at 1 : 2 b
Element at 2 : 3 c
Element at 3 : 4 d
Element at 4 : 5 e
