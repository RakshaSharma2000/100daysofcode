QUESTION OF THE DAY:
Java program to demonstrate the removing of the elements from the stack.
DESCRIPTION:
Java Collection framework provides a Stack class that models and implements a Stack data structure. 
The class is based on the basic principle of last-in-first-out. In addition to the basic push and pop operations, 
the class provides three more functions of empty, search, and peek. The class can also be said to extend Vector and treats 
the class as a stack with the five mentioned functions. The class can also be referred to as the subclass of Vector.
How to Create a Stack:
Stack<E> stack = new Stack<E>();
Removing Elements from the stack:
To pop an element from the stack, we can use the pop() method. 
The element is popped from the top of the stack and is removed from the same.
CODE SOLUTION:
package Raksha;
import java.util.*;
public class StackPop {
    public static void main(String args[])
        {
            // Creating an empty Stack
            Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
            stack.push(10);
            stack.push(15);
            stack.push(30);
            stack.push(20);
            stack.push(5);
            System.out.println("Initial Stack: " + stack);
            System.out.println("Popped element: "
                    + stack.pop());
            System.out.println("Popped element: "
                    + stack.pop());
            System.out.println("Stack after pop operation "
                    + stack);
        }
    }
CODE OUTPUT:
Initial Stack: [10, 15, 30, 20, 5]
Popped element: 5
Popped element: 20
Stack after pop operation [10, 15, 30]
