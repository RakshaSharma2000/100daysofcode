QUESTION OF THE DAY:
Java Singleton Pattern
DESCRIPTION:
In object-oriented programming, a singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time.
After the first time, if we try to instantiate the Singleton class, the new variable also points to the first instance created. 
So whatever modifications we do to any variable inside the class through any instance, affects the variable of the single instance created and is visible
if we access that variable through any variable of that class type defined. 
CODE SOLUTION:
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.text.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.util.regex.*;
import java.lang.reflect.*;
class Singleton{
static Singleton instance = new Singleton();
 private Singleton() {
 }
    
    public String str;
    
    static Singleton getSingleInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
    }
TEST CASES:
Sample Input

hello world
Sample Output

Hello I am a singleton! Let me say hello world to you
