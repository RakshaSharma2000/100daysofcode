QUESTION OF THE DAY:
Find the missing number in the array.
DESCRIPTION :
Find the sum of the numbers in the range [1, N] using the formula total_num*((total_num +1) / 2). 
Now find the sum of all the elements in the array and subtract it from the sum of the first N natural numbers. 
This will give the value of the missing element.
Follow the steps mentioned below to implement the idea:

Calculate the sum of the first N natural numbers as total_num*((total_num +1) / 2)
Traverse the array from start to end.
Find the sum of all the array elements.
Print the missing number as(expected_num_sum â€“ num_sum)
CODE SOLUTION:
package Raksha;
import java.util.*;

public class Missingnumber {

        public static void main(String[] args) {

            int total_num;
            int[] numbers = new int[]{1,2,3,4,6,7};
            total_num = 7;
            int expected_num_sum = total_num * ((total_num + 1) / 2);
            int num_sum = 0;
            for (int i: numbers) {
                num_sum += i;
            }
            System.out.print( expected_num_sum - num_sum);
            System.out.print("\n");
        }
    }
 CODE OUTPUT:
  5
